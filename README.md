Blackjack Game

This project is a simple blackjack game I created to test some of the basic coding principles I was taught in my first-year.

I plan on returning and re-creating it with additional features once I have learned more.

If you find any issues that did not occur in the black-box testing or see any ways to make the code more efficient, please send me a message.

Have fun :)
